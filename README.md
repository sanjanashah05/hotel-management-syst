Project Description: Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a database-driven application built using Python and MySQL, with a user-friendly
interface created using the Tkinter library. This project provides functionality to manage hotel room reservations
efficiently. It is designed for small-to-medium-sized hotels, enabling staff to book, cancel, and monitor room
availability seamlessly.

Key Features:
1. Room Booking
- Users can book available rooms, and once a room is booked, it is automatically marked as unavailable in the
system.

2. Cancel Reservation
- Users can cancel an existing reservation, freeing up the room and making it available for new bookings.

3. Dynamic Room Availability
- A live view of available rooms is displayed, showing room details such as ID, type, price, and status.

4. Database Integration
- The system uses MySQL as the database backend to store and manage room details, reservations, and customer
information.

5. Frontend Interface
- A graphical user interface (GUI) allows hotel staff to interact with the system without requiring database
knowledge.

This project demonstrates efficient room management with real-time updates, integrating core CRUD operations
with a responsive user interface.
